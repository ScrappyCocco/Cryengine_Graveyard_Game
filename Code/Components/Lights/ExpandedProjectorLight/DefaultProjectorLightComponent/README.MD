This code is a copy of the Cryengine default Projector light (also known as SpotLight), that can be found in:

```
CryPlugins/CryDefaultEntities/Module/DefaultComponents/Lights/ProjectorLightComponent
```

This because to inherit from it, it's necessary to have a copy of the .cpp to build and link it.
